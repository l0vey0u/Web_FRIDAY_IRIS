## Prolog

[![Food Waste Disposal Costs Problem](https://img.youtube.com/vi/nciqfJ8wz0g/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nciqfJ8wz0g)

There is vicious circle at cafeteria

Overordering -> Over-food production -> A lot of leftover -> Excessive Food Waste Disposal Costs

The number of people who eat dinner on weekends is greatly reduced, while food production remains unchanged.

This leads to a lot of leftovers.

However, the chef cooked according to the number of people scheduled for the official dinner.

To solve this problem, let's find out how many people are actually going to eat dinner using DeepLearning.

Predictions will be effective if only certain patterns are found in cafeteria

This program consists of several  services that interact each other
